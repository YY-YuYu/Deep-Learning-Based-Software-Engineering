We have recently published a survey **[Deep Learning-based Software Engineering: Progress, Challenges, and Opportunities](https://www.sciengine.com/SCIS/doi/10.1007/s11432-023-4127-5)** <button onclick="document.getElementById('hidden-text').style.display='block'">
BIBTEX</button> in SCIENCE CHINA Information Sciences. Although we have tried our best to collect related papers publicly available before the publication of our survey paper, there must be closely related papers published after the cutoff date. To construct an updated list of related papers in learning-based software engineering, we construct this website to continuously collect relevant papers in the field and translate the latest cutting-edge developments.
